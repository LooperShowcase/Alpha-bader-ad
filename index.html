  <p>
    Škoda Auto a.s. (Czech pronunciation: [ˈʃkoda] ⓘ), often shortened to
    Škoda, is a Czech automobile manufacturer established in 1925 as the
    successor to Laurin & Klement and headquartered in Mladá Boleslav, Czech
    Republic. Škoda Works became state owned in 1948. After 1991, it was
    gradually privatized to the German Volkswagen Group, becoming a partial
    subsidiary in 1994 and a wholly owned subsidiary in 2000.[

 <h1>History the skoda</h1>

<div id="mydiv20">

<p>
  The Škoda Works was established as an arms manufacturer in 1859. It was one of the largest European industrial conglomerates of the 20th century, founded by Czech engineer Emil Škoda in 1859 in Plzeň, then in the Kingdom of Bohemia, Austrian Empire. It is the predecessor of today's Škoda Auto, Doosan Škoda Power and Škoda Transportation companies

<h1>Logo skoda</h1>

<div id="mydiv30">


<p>
  In 1923, two different trademarks were registered at the Office for Innovation and Model Registration in Plzeň. The first depicted a winged arrow pointing to the right with five feathers in a circle and the second was a winged arrow with three feathers. The famous winged arrow with three feathers still forms the Škoda logo today. The ŠKODA text was added to the logo in 1936. The arrow represents speed, the wings progress and freedom, the eye precision and the circle unity, completeness, world and harmony.[72][73] The story goes that, on his travels through the US, Emil Škoda had once been so taken with a Native American's feathered headdress that he had returned to Plzeň with a relief image which inspired the logo.[74]

<h1>Growth strategy</h1>

<div id="mydiv40">


<p>
  One of the most important years for Škoda Auto was 2010, in terms of both products and management. On 1 September 2010, Prof. Dr. H.C. Winfried Vahland assumed responsibility for the management of the company, becoming the CEO of Škoda Auto. In the same year, Škoda set forth plans to double the company's annual sales to at least 1.5 million by 2018 (later known as the 'Growth Strategy', Czech: Růstová strategie).[31]
